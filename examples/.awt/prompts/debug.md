# Continue fixing CI failures

Please analyze the summary and quoted log lines above and do the following:

1) Identify the failing tests/files and the root cause.
2) Propose minimal, targeted fixes (code edits or test updates).
3) If unclear, run read-only commands to gather more context (git/gh/cat/grep/rg).
4) Apply fixes and re-run tests locally as needed.
5) Push updates to the same branch and confirm CI turns green.

Prefer small, safe changes. Explain any risky edits.
